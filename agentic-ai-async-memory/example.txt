            LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. 
            It enables applications that are context-aware and can reason about their environment.
            
            Key Components:
            1. LLMs and Chat Models - The core language model interface
            2. Prompts - Templates and strategies for formatting inputs
            3. Chains - Sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities
            4. Agents - Use LLMs to decide which actions to take
            5. Memory - Persist state between calls
            6. Document Loaders - Load data from various sources
            
            RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):
            RAG combines retrieval and generation to provide more accurate and contextual responses.
            It works by first retrieving relevant documents, then using those documents to generate responses.
            
            Vector Stores:
            Vector stores enable semantic search by storing document embeddings.
            Common vector stores include Chroma, FAISS, and Pinecone.
